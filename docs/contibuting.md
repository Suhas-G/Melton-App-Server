# Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch in that forked repo.
2. After all your changes are done, while committing your changes try to follow the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines. I found a nice blog explaining it. https://nitayneeman.com/posts/understanding-semantic-commit-messages-using-git-and-angular/
3.  After committing, pull first so that you can resolve any merge conflicts on your local and the push your changes.
4.  Now create a pull request from your forked branch to the master branch of original repo. Notify someone to review the code changes and merge the pull request.
